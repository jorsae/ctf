Aftering checking both keys they are very similar.

Using the following command we can check the exponent:
openssl rsa -in key1.pem -pubin -noout -text
	Exponent: 65,537

openssl rsa -in key2.pem -pubin -noout -text
	Exponent: 343,223

There is no way to generate a private key to decrypt them from just the public key.
But they are vulnerable to a common modulus attack.

Used https://github.com/HexPandaa/RSA-Common-Modulus-Attack
and cracked the password: 
HTB{C0mmon_M0dUlu5S_1S_b4D}
