XOR is bidirectional
a ^ b = c
c ^ b = a
c ^ a = b

HTB flag format starts with HTB{
We can also see that the key is 4 characters long and that the flag is in hex.

therefore by xor the start of the output.txt with the HTB{
we can get the key
    13 ^ H = key1
    4a ^ T = key2
    f6 ^ B = key3
    e1 ^ { = key4

Once we have all the keys, we just need to xor the entire output
and we get HTB{rep34t3d_x0r_n0t_s0_s3cur3}
